Issue 15 - Story - List of Clothing Items
--------------------------------------
One of two pull requests - USES A DATASERVICE (Factory) and a JS filter Method
(The other uses a service and an Angular Filer metod.)

From my reading, factorties seem preferred and Angular filers are hard to test.

ionic serve to run

karma/jasmine tests included.  
Install Karma and Jasmine to use.

Some are failing and have been skipped.
Would like feedback on why data is undefined.

gulp method added to use ->    gulp test
